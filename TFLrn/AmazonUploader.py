#mnist now contains the MNIST dataset as a specialized tensorflow Dataset class
# this class has many convenience methods built into it


#print(mnist.train.images)# this will print the array of all training images as array. These are flattened .ie. [784] pixels array per image
#print(mnist.train.num_examples)# this will print how many training examples are there (55000 in this case)
#print(mnist.test.num_examples)# this will print how many test examples are there (10000 in this case)
#print(mnist.validation.num_examples)# this will print how many validation examples are there (5000 in this case)

    # there is a nice helper function in tf itself that computes 2d convolution
    # it takes in an input tensor and an input kernel or filter tensor and then
    # performs convolution on it depending on what strides and what padding you provide.
    # So in the helper function, we will create a wrapper around it to setup the parameters.
    # x: is the input set of image tensors
    # x ---> [batch,H,W,Channels] - batch is no of images in batch, H: height, W:Width, Channels: no of channels
    # W ---> [filter H, filter W, channels IN, channels OUT] - filter height, filter width, no. of Channels coming in
    # no. of Channels going out
    def conv2d(x,W):
        return tf.nn.conv2d(x,W,strides=[1,1,1,1],padding='SAME')

    # there is already a tensorflow function for pooling
    # we will just create a wrapper around it
    def max_pool_2by2(x):
        # x ---> [batch,height,width,channels]

        # I only want to do pooling along height and width of the individual image
        # [1,2,2,1]

    #features we are computing. So, 32 is the no. of output channels
