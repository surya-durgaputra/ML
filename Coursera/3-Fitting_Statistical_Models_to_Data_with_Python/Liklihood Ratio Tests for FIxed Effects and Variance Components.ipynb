    "# Hypothesis Testing for Multilevel Regression Models\n",
    "\n",
    "- When fitting multilevel models, many hypothesis tests regarding the parameters are based on comparisons of competing models\n",
    "- __Reference model__: A “full” or “saturated” model containing all parameters of interest; different from the null model where only intercepts are included\n",
    "- __Nested model__: A “reduced” model, where some of the parameters in the reference model are constrained to zero\n",
    "\n",
    "# Likelihood Ratio Testing\n",
    "- Compared to the reference model, does fitting the nested model substantially drop the likelihood (or make the observed data seem less likely)?\n",

    "# Likelihood Ratio Tests for Fixed Effects\n",
    "- Simple idea, but assumes “large” sample of clusters and “large” samples within clusters\n",
    "- __Null hypothesis__: selected fixed effects are all equal to zero (not important predictors)\n",
    "- __Test statistic__: difference in final -2 ML log-likelihoods between nested and reference models (nested model has some fixed effects set to zero)\n",
    "- Refer difference to chi-square distribution with q degrees of freedom, where q is difference between two models in number of fixed effects estimated\n",

    "Same approach as for fixed effects, __using restricted maximum likelihood__\n",

    "- Null hypothesis: The variance of the random interviewer effects on the slope of interest is zero (in other words, these random effects on the slope are not needed in the model)\n",
    "- Alternative hypothesis: The variance of the random interviewer effects on the slope of interest is greater than zero\n",
    "- First, fit the model WITH random interviewer effects on the slope of interest, using restricted maximum likelihood estimation\n",

    "- We would follow the same approach when testing the variance of the random interviewer effects on the intercept\n",
    "- If we fit a model that ONLY includes random effects of the clusters on the intercept (a random intercept model), we would test that variance by removing the random effects, and referring the same test statistic to a mixture of chi-square distributions with 0 and 1 DF, and equal weight 0.5"
