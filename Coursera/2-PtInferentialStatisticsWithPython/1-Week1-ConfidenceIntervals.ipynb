Because of this question, sometimes you want to maximize the estimated standard error, and how is it done, is by plugging in p hat of 0.5. So at p-hat of 0.5, we would have 0.5 times 0.5 divided by n, all underneath a square root. So it's like 0.5 squared, or one-half, so the one-half comes out of the square root.

    "\n",
    " So, let's think about that. __Does it seem like there's a difference in the two population proportions?__ In order to understand if there's a difference in the two population proportions, we can look at what our parameter is. If we're looking at intervals of differences, we can think about, __is there a difference between the two perimeters?__ \n",
    "- If both of the perimeters are equal, that would mean the difference in our two parameters is zero. So, $p_1 \\ - \\ p_2$ would be equals zero if those two parameters were in fact the same. \n",

    "\n",
    "So, since our confidence interval is a range of reasonable values for our parameter, we want to look to see if __zero is in the range of reasonable values__. If zero seems to be reasonable in our confidence interval, that implies that it seems possible that the parameters are equal to each other, that there truly is no difference between our two population proportions, or whatever our two parameters are. If zero is not contained in that confidence interval, it seems like our parameters are pretty likely to be unequal. They don't seem like they're very similar to each other or they are same, and so that indicates there might be a difference in the two population proportions or whatever parameter that we're looking at.\n",

    "1. First assumption is that we need to assume that we have two independent random samples. This really occurs within the sampling scheme, and so that needs to be told to you beforehand. It either has been done or hasn't been done, there's not really a way to check that once you've been given the information from your samples. \n",
    "2. Our second assumption is that we also need large enough sample sizes to assume that the distribution of our estimate is normal. What that means in this case is, we need $n_1 \\hat{p_1}$ and $n_1 (1-\\hat{p_1})$ and $n_2 \\hat{p_2}$ and $n_2 (1-\\hat{p_2})$, all to be at least 10. (That means that we need at least 10 yeses and at least 10 nos in each of the samples. )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We found in our example that our confidence interval showed that the population proportion of white children who have had swimming lessons is somewhere between about 11 percent to about 25 percent higher than the population proportion of black children who have had swimming lessons. We've talked a little bit about how you can interpret that confidence interval.

    "Now, the histogram is showing us that the cartwheel distances that were traveled were from below 70 inches up to, well, over 110 inches. We do also see a little bit of a right-skewed shape in our distribution, and that's further verified when we look at our QQ plot where that tail is off a little bit on the lower end. We do need to have a normal model or a bell-shaped model is a reasonable model for our response in our population in order for our confidence interval procedures to be reasonable, but we also do have a sample size here of 25 observations which is starting to be large enough for us to rely a little bit on that central limit theorem result.\n",

    "\n",
    "On the top, we have $\\sigma$, that is the true standard deviation for that population of all cartwheel distances. On the bottom, we've got that factor of the sample size, $\\sqrt{n}$. So, the variability or accuracy of our sample mean depends on these two features, how much variation was in the original population of measurements that we took our data from, and how much data do we take from that population. Certainly, a nice feature is that the sample size is on the bottom. So, what's going to happen to this standard error? If we were able to have a larger sample size in our repeated study or that standard error will be smaller, giving us that our sample means would vary less from that true mean mu. Now, the drawback of this expression is that we can never calculate it. That $\\sigma$ on the top, that true standard deviation for our population of all cartwheel distances for all adults, we don't know what that is, and unless we can look at the entire population of measurements, we couldn't calculate it. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, we are going to have to come up with an estimate of this measure of variability, this standard error, and use what we have. We did take some data from the population, we have some measurements of cartwheel distances, we can measure the variability in that sample with our sample standard deviation $s \\ = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(X-\\bar{X})^2}{n-1}}$, and we're going to use that instead and replace our $\\sigma$ with $s$. So, then we're going to be talking about having an estimated standard error rather than the actual standard error. But at least it's something we can calculate and use to form our confidence interval.\n",

In this case, we are not going to require that you have to have a large sample size in order to conduct a confidence interval for a population mean unlike the requirement for a large enough sample size in proportions. Since we're using s instead of $\\sigma$ in that estimated standard error, we're going to have to adjust for that few. It's no longer going to be able to be just that 1.96 value that we were using when we were doing inference for proportions. This multiplier, this few is going to have to be coming from a different distribution called a t-distribution. Which is going to be indexed by some idea of how much data we have. n minus one degrees of freedom. To give you a feel for what these multipliers look like, if we do want to be 95% confident and we have a sample size of 25 as we do here, then the multiplier's going to have to be a little bit more than 2.064, in order to have that 95% Confidence Level attained.\n",

    "# Estimating a Mean Difference for Paired Data\n",
    "\n",
    " When we have paired data, we want to treat the two sets of values simultaneously. We can't look at them separately because they're matched in some way. For example:\n",
    " - you might ask a person to write their name with their dominant and their non-dominant hand. It's the same person, same name, just two different hands. \n",
    " - the length of fingers for piano players on their dominant and non-dominant hand or their right and their left hand to see how those are different. \n",
    " - measurement pre and post treatment. So an individual is measured before some treatment, and then takes a pill and is measured again after some treatment.\n",
    " - In addition to being collected on the same individual, we might have measurements that are collected on matched individuals in some way. So in this case we have the twin data, we have our individuals that are matched because they're twins. These individuals don't necessarily have to be people, they could be something like candles. In this case, we might be looking at candles. For example, we might be interested into two different wicks. And we might match candles based on their height or other characteristics, to see how those wicks burn in these different sets of candles.\n",
    "- we might have individuals that are matched because they're related to each other. For example, a son and a grandfather or something like that.\n",
    "- You might also have individuals that are matched or, You might also individuals that are matched based on some other characteristics. So for example, age, gender, and weight if you're looking at a weight loss program.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in each of these cases, we'll need to come up with a new variable. We'll look at the difference of measurements within pairs. So that we're directly comparing between those two individuals with those two measurements that are captured together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research question: We are studying twins that came to a twins festival in twinsburg, Ohio in 976. In our case, our research question is what is the average difference between the older twin's and the younger twin's self-reported education? \n",
    "\n",
    "__Our goal here is that we'd like to construct a 95% confidence interval for the mean difference of self reported education for that set of identical twins.__\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, our population will be all identical twins. We'll only be looking at identical twins for this survey. \n",
    "\n",
    "And our parameter of interest will be the population mean difference of self reported education level, this is $\\mu_D$. Now here we do have to specify what way we're calculating that difference. In our case, it'll be the older twin minus the younger twin in terms of their education.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the difference is what leads us to use that subscript $D$. You'll see that throughout this presentation. You'll see that we use that subscript $D$ quite often to indicate that we're looking at a difference variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Now we do have a couple of assumptions that we should check before we actually perform this calculation__. \n",
    "- We do need to assume that we have a random sample of identical twin sets. \n",
    "- We also need to assume that the population of differences is normal. We did look at that histogram earlier, and they look roughly normal, roughly bell shaped. But we also do have a large enough sample size, we have 340 observations in our sample, and so this can help us bypass that assumption. That assumption of normality isn't quite as important with the large sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually do the calculation, we calculate the differences, store them in a dataframe column and call describe() to get summary statistics. It will give you the best estimate for mean difference and the estimate for the population standard error (remember, due to lack of population standard error $\\sigma$, we will use sample standard error $s$ as the estimate for the population standard error. To account for this approximation, we will use the multipliers from the t-distribution, even though, in this case we had a sample size of n=340. So that means we have a slightly heavier tail, and our confidence interval will be a little bit more conservative, because we have estimated that standard error.)\n",

    "\n",
    "the only caveat being, since our sample size n=340, the $t^{\\ast}$ multiplier is 1.967 (with n-1 degree of freedom)\n",
    "\n",
    "so our interval of reasonable values is between 0.0025 years and 0.1652 years with 95% confidence. Since there is no zero in the interval of reasonable values, we can conclude with 95% confidence that the older twin, on average, had slightly higher education than younger twin.

    "# Confidence Intervals: Other Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confidence intervals and coverage probabilities\n",
    "A __confidence interval (CI)__ is an interval of the form (a, b), that is constructed from the data. The purpose of a CI is to cover an unknown population parameter with “high probability” (we use probability here since it is not possible to construct an interval that is guaranteed to always cover the population parameter of interest). For example, if we want to estimate the mean body mass index (BMI) in a population of people, where the true mean BMI is 25.5, then the interval (24, 26.2) would cover the target, while the interval (26.1, 28) would not.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is defined through its __lower confidence bound (LCB)__ and its __upper confidence bound (UCB)__, which are both functions of the data. The population parameter of interest, denoted here by θ (theta), is an unknown constant. In the example above, θ = 25.5. The “coverage probability” of the confidence interval is the probability that LCB <= θ <= UCB, written P(LCB <= θ <= UCB). The coverage probability is set by the researcher, and in most cases will be set to 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coverage probability is defined in terms of (hypothetical) repeated sampling of multiple data sets from the population of interest. Over many such repeated samples, constructing one CI from each sample, there will be a fraction of the confidence intervals that cover the target. __This fraction is the coverage probability__.\n",
    "\n",
    "A wider confidence interval will have an easier time covering the target than a narrower one. On the other hand, a very wide interval is not very informative (imagine if we reported the fraction of voters supporting a particular candidate in an election as 55%, with a 95% CI spanning from 2% to 98%). Thus, the primary goal when constructing an interval is to “adapt to the data”, yielding a wider interval when the power is low and uncertainty is high, and a narrower interval when the power is high and uncertainty is low.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally the “actual” coverage probability of a confidence interval obtained in practice will match the intended or “nominal” coverage probability. But a CI may fail to perform as desired. This is because a CI may be used in a setting where the conditions under which it was derived are violated. Here we will explore some common reasons why this may occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual coverage probability of a confidence interval may be either less than the nominal coverage level (yielding an “anti-conservative” interval), or greater than the nominal coverage level (yielding a “conservative” interval). Although a conservative interval is often viewed slightly more favorably than an anti-conservative interval, both of these outcomes are undesirable -- we wish to obtain an interval whose actual coverage is as close as possible to the nominal coverage probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to reiterate that in practice, we obtain one confidence interval from one sample. This CI either covers or fails to cover the target value. For a specific data set, we do not know whether the CI derived from it actually covers the target value, but this is something that is either true or false - there is no probability involved when discussing whether one specific CI covers the target value.\n",
    "\n",
    "We rarely have multiple independent samples from the same population, so we cannot usually verify that a confidence interval attains its intended coverage probability. To reassure ourselves that the desired coverage is attained, we can study the theoretical properties that would be guaranteed to result in the intended coverage rate being achieved. We can also use computer simulations to assess how a given method for constructing CIs performs in various hypothetical settings. Statisticians make use of both of these approaches when assessing the performance of confidence intervals in particular settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "__The confidence intervals we have seen so far are all constructed using two key quantities__:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. an unbiased estimate of a population parameter, and\n",
    "2. the standard error of this estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are interested in estimating the population mean based on an independent and identically distributed (iid) sample of data, the unbiased estimate is the sample mean (x̄ or x_bar), and the standard error of this estimate is s/sqrt(n) (or σ/√n), where s is the standard deviation of the data, and n is the sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many confidence intervals are constructed using the form “point estimate +/- K standard errors.\" For example, when working with the sample mean x̄ (x_bar), the interval is x̄ +/- 1.96 σ/√n. The constant K is chosen to give the desired level of coverage. Specifically, we need the “Z-score” σ/√n * (x̄ - mu) / s to fall between -K and K with probability alpha. As long as this holds, then the interval x̄ +/- K *σ/√n will have the intended coverage probability. The constant K plays a very important role in determining the properties of a CI, and will be discussed in more detail below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructing confidence intervals\n",
    "There are two ways we can obtain values of K to use in constructing the CI. One approach is based on making the very strong assumption that the data are independent and identically distributed, and follow a normal (Gaussian) distribution. If this is the case, then the Z-score follows a Student-t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom. If we set K equal to the 1 - (1 - ɑ)/2 quantile of the Student-t distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom, then the resulting interval will have the intended coverage rate. Values of K constructed from the Student t-distribution will range from 2 to 2.5 for 95% coverage intervals if the sample size is greater than 5 (samples smaller than 5 observations are rare in practice). Thus, most CIs will be constructed by taking a “margin of error” around the point estimate that is between 2 and 2.5 times the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative and much more broadly applicable basis for obtaining a value for K is to use the “central limit theorem” (CLT). The CLT states that the sample mean of independent and identically distributed values will be approximately normally distributed. The CLT also implies that the Z-score will be approximately normally distributed. Importantly, the CLT provides these guarantees even when the individual data values have distributions that are not normal, as long as the sample size is “sufficiently large.” There are some additional technical conditions needed for the CLT to be applicable, but we will not discuss them here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there is no universal rule that defines how large the sample size should be to invoke the central limit theorem. In general, if the data distribution is close to being normal, then the Z-scores will be close to normally-distributed even when the sample size is quite small (e.g. around 10). If the individual data values are far from being normally distributed (e.g. they are strongly skewed or have heavy tails), then the CLT may not be relevant until the sample size is larger, say around 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "As long as we can justify invoking the CLT, it is appropriate to use the 1 - (1 - ɑ)/2 quantile of the normal distribution to define K, which leads to setting K=1.96 in order to achieve an (approximate) 95% coverage probability. Thus, normality of the individual data values is not needed for a CI to have good coverage properties. It is good practice to inspect the distribution of a sample before proceeding to construct a confidence interval for its mean, for example, by looking at a histogram or quantile plot of the data. But it is not necessary that this show a nearly-normal distribution in order for the confidence interval to be meaningful, unless the sample size is very small and the data are strongly non-normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common practice is to use K as calculated from the Student-t distribution, even when the data are not taken to be normal. The rationale for doing this is that even though the Z-scores do not follow a Student-t distribution in this setting, the values of K obtained using the t-distribution will always be slightly larger than 1.96. Thus, the coverage will be slightly higher when using the t-distribution to calculate K compared to when using the normal distribution. Using a slightly larger value of K helps compensate for several possible factors that could lead to the Z-scores being slightly heavier-tailed than predicted by a normal distribution. As the sample size grows, the values of K obtained from the normal and t-distributions will become very similar. The distinction between using these two approaches is therefore mainly relevant when the sample size is smaller than around 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Alternative procedures for challenging situations\n",
    "There are a few ways to reduce the risk that strong non-normality will lead to confidence intervals with poor performance. In order to provide some exposure to the types of procedures that statisticians use to conduct inference in challenging situations, we discuss two of these approaches next.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with the sample proportions, it is common to add two extra “successes” and two extra “failures” to the data before calculating the proportion. Thus, if we observe 5 successes and 7 failures, instead of estimating the success rate as 5 / (5 + 7), we estimate it as 7 / (7 + 9). The standard error is also estimated using this adjustment. The resulting confidence interval generally has better coverage properties than the usual CI when the sample size is small. This interval is often called the “Agresti-Coull” interval, after its inventors.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with strongly skewed data, another practical technique for improving the coverage properties of intervals is to transform the data with a skew-reducing transformation, e.g. a log transformation, then calculate the interval in the usual way (as described above) using the transformed data. The resulting interval can be transformed back to the original scale by applying the inverse transformation to the LCB and UCB. For example, if the transformation is the natural logarithm, the inverse transformation would be to exponentiate (anti-log) the LCB and UCB.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In summary, although normality of the data can play a role in determining the coverage properties of a confidence interval, it is generally not a major factor unless the sample size is quite small (much smaller than 50), or if the data are strongly non-normal. In most cases, other factors besides Gaussianity of the individual data values are more likely to give rise to sub-optimal coverage. Two such factors that can cause major problems with CI coverage probabilities are clustering or other forms of dependence in the data, and overt or hidden pre-testing or multiplicity in the analysis. Clustering will be discussed extensively in Course 3. We will discuss multiplicity in Week 3 of this course."

    "# What Affects the Standard Error of an Estimate?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far in the specialization, we have been emphasizing the importance of the standard error of a statistical estimate for making inference about the parameter being estimated. Recall from Week 4 of the first course of this specialization that this quantity provides us with an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of estimates that would arise if we had drawn repeated samples of the same size and computed the same estimate for each random sample. In a simplified sense, the standard error gives us a sense of the uncertainty associated with our estimate. Estimates with smaller standard errors are thus consider more precise.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what exactly impacts a standard error in terms of a study design? Below is a list of design features that would generally affect the standard error of an estimate. There is clearly a cost component associated with this list, as some of the design features would certainly require more financial resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) __The variance of the variables of interest that are used to compute the estimate.__\n",
    "In general, the more variability that is associated with a given variable being measured, the more imprecise estimates based on that variable will be. This makes careful and precise measurement of the variables of interest very important for any given study.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) __The size of the sample.__\n",
    "Larger samples will tend to produce sampling distributions with less variability (or, in other words, estimates with smaller standard errors). The more sample that can be measured, the better, but we also have to think carefully about the first point above. Just because we have a set of “big data” does not mean that we have a collection of precise measurements. Very unusual measures (outliers) could have strong influence on the variance of a given variable, and this requires careful descriptive assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) __The amount of dependence in the observations collected, possibly due to cluster sampling.__\n",
    "In studies were clusters of units with similar characteristics are measured, the data collected will not be entirely independent with a given cluster (neighborhood, clinic, school, etc.). This is because units coming from the same cluster will generally have similar values on the variables of interest, and this could happen for a variety of reasons. This lack of independence in the observations collected reduces our effective sample size; we don’t have as much unique information as the size of our sample would suggest. We can account for this dependence within clusters by using specialized statistical procedures to estimate standard errors in a way that accounts for cluster sampling. The same problem arises in longitudinal studies, where we collect repeated measurements from the same individuals over time. While it may look like we have a large sample of observations, many of these observations will be strongly correlated with each other, and we need to account for this. In general, with these types of clustered data, standard errors will tend to be much larger, because the estimates computed across different studies will entirely depend on what clusters are under study. If the clusters tend to vary substantially in terms of the measures of interest, the variability of the sampling distribution will increase! Furthermore, the larger the sample size selected from each cluster (and thus the smaller the sample of clusters), the larger the standard errors will tend to be.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) __The stratification of the target sample.__\n",
    "If we select a stratified sample from a target population (see Week 4 of Course 1), we will tend to produce estimates with increased precision, because we are removing between-stratum variance from the variability of our estimates by design! Stratification of samples is always an important consideration, for this reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) __The use of sampling weights to compute our estimates.__\n",
    "While sampling weights are often necessary to compute unbiased population estimates, the use of weights in estimation can inflate the variance of our estimates. We can use specialized statistical procedures to make sure that our standard errors reflect the uncertainty in our estimates due to weighting. In general, the higher the variability in our weights, the more variable our estimates will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "These five features are generally the main drivers of standard errors, but other design features may also ultimately affect standard errors (e.g., imputation of missing data). We will touch on these throughout the specialization."
