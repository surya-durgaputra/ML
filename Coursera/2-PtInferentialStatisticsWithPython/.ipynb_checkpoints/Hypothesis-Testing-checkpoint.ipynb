So, here's the numerical summaries of our 25 cartwheel distance measurements. Of interest here is that the mean of our sample is 82.48 inches. Certainly that looks to be more than 80, but our question will be is it significantly more than 80? We do know that that mean of 82.48 inches is our mean of our sample and if we were to repeat the study again with another 25 adults, we might get a slightly different answer. So, we have to establish whether that 82.48 is significantly larger than the 80 inches in our null theory.\n",

So, is this difference that we're seeing out here at 82.48 inches significant or is it just a value that's reflecting that natural variability in the sample mean? We will be able to answer this question by calculating standard error of sample mean and then take the ratio of the mean with sem. We will do this later.\n",

The main assumptions for doing the test for a one-sample t-test for mean is that the sample could be considered a random sample and then that the model for our population of all cartwheel distances can be assumed to be bell-shaped or normal. Now that normality condition is not quite as crucial if our sample size is large enough because we'll be able to rely on that Central Limit theorem, but we should still graph our data and take a look at what it wants to say to us. So, here is a histogram and a Q-Q plot of our 25 cartwheel distance measurements. And both of these graphical summaries are showing some modest deviations from that bell curve or normality condition. However, we do have 25 observations, that's a reasonable sample size starting to be somewhat large enough so that we could say that CLT, that Central Limit Theorem is still going to allow us to have the model for the sample means be approximately normal, so that initial normality condition for the original population isn't quite so crucial.\n",

    "    First, we need to know what model our test statistic follows, and t test statistics end up following a t distribution with a certain degrees of freedom to index which distribution we're working with. T distributions are still somewhat bell-shaped, they just have a little thicker tails than our normal distributions we were working with in the past for testing about proportions, and the degrees of freedom indicate how thick those tails are. The other thing to keep in mind is this idea of what is more extreme. Since our theory was that we might be bigger than 80 inches our direction was to the right, the more extreme will be measured as large or larger in that upper tail (right hand tail). So, let's look at a picture of that P-value. Here is a t distribution with 24 degrees of freedom, 25 minus one, and along the axes, we have various test statistic values that are possible. Our test statistic of 0.82 is noted, and we have shaded here the probability that represents this P-value. How likely is it to get 0.82 or something more extreme, larger? Well, that probability is actually pretty high, it's 0.21, little more than 20 percent of the time, you would see the result we got or something more extreme if $H_0$ were really true. It isn't that unusual. Seeing the results we got is actually quite likely under that null theory. \n",

    "So, we take this probability value (p-value) that's now in a probability scale, and we make an evaluation of it to make our decision in the same way for all tests. If our P-value is big compared to our significance level, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null. We say we fail to reject that null theory. If the P-value turned out to be small less than or equal to the significance level, saying that our data was more unusual than what we required it to be under h naught to convince us to reject it, we'll then we'd reject $H_0$.\n",

    "__Confidence intervals give us a range of reasonable values for our parameter. So, we're going to look at a confidence interval at the 90 percent level of confidence. Because if we had 90 percent as our area in between that is going to leave five percent in each tail, total of 10 and we're doing a test of hypotheses with a five percent significance level in our upper tail. So, the appropriate multiplier to give us that 90 percent level of confidence will be used and the confidence interval turns out to go from 77 to a little over 87 inches. This is a range of reasonable values for what we think the population mean might be. Now, our theory was that the population mean might be equal to 80 inches or is it significantly greater. Even though our sample mean was greater than 80 inches, when we extend and allow for the variability that sample means will have, we dip down below that 80 inches. The 80 inches is inside our confidence interval of reasonable values for this population mean cart will distance. We cannot refute that 80 and support that it's significantly greater than 80 because the entire interval is not above the 80 inches.__"

We can get put assumption if we have a large sample size about 25 or more. In this case we only have 20 observations. So, we'll look to see if it seems reasonable that the population of differences is normally distributed. We can look at a normal Q-Q plot. Typically you would hope to see that all of our points fall along a straight line. In this case, the line wouldn't be perfectly straight that connects all of these points, but in general, the line should be relatively straight, and given that we have 20 observations that's close to that 25, plus our points fall roughly along that straight line, this is a reasonable assumption.

This will be our p-value, in this case our p value is going to be 0.014, that means that we would observe a test statistic as extreme or more extreme, only about 1.4 percent of the time.

The graph on the left, we want to look bell-shaped to represent a normal distribution. The graphs on the right, we really want the data points to follow that line running down the middle.

Here, we can see that there's quite a bit of deviation for the female group especially in that bottom right plot, a little bit less so for the male group in the q-q plot.
