    "- Never modify the source data files (you want to preserve a record of the data as you received it).\n",
    "- Write a script (e.g. a Python program) to generate your analysis files from the source data files.\n",
    "Advantages of this approach: If new source data arrives, the analysis files can be updated using the script. Also, complex data management can be reproduced and is documented through the code in the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name variables with brief interpretable names.\n",
    "- Short variable names convey too little meaning, and very long names are awkward to use in complex expressions\n",
    "- Variable names consisting only of letters (a-z, case sensitive), numbers (not as the first character) and the underscore character (_) will be handled easily by most statistical software.\n",
    "- Whitespace in variable names is allowed in Python/Pandas, but confuses analysis based on formulas. To avoid this, use (for example) \"birth_date\" instead of \"birth date\".\n",
    "- Most statistical software will treat blank, “NA”, or “.” as a missing value."

    "- Spreadsheet graphs and charts will generally be ignored when importing spreadsheet data into statistical software.\n",
    "- Each sheet in a spreadsheet workbook is usually imported as a separate dataset.\n",

    "- The data in a CSV file is “delimited”, usually by a comma or a tab.\n",
    "- Large data sets can be saved in compressed form (e.g. using “gzip”) and read into statistical software directly from the compressed file. This allows the data to be read much faster, and reduces storage space.\n",

    "Some statistical software packages have proprietary binary file formats (e.g. SAS7BDAT for SAS or DTA for Stata). These can usually be read directly into Python/Pandas but in some cases challenges arise.

Other factors, like diet, age, and gender may also affect weight change and come into play when looking at the relationship between activity level and weight change. If one doesn’t control for these factors, the relationship between activity level and weight change can be distorted.\n",
